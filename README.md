# sequelizedBurger or Burger 2: The Sequel

### Overview

In this assignment, I used the previous week's `Eat-Da-Burger` app and replaced the ORM with Sequelize. 

* Removed all references to vanilla MySQL queries and replaced them with Sequelize queries

* Replaced MySQL `Burger` model with a Sequelized equivalent

* Edited the model and initial migration file to make the burgers devoured field carry a default value of false

* Synced the models

* Edited new `config.json` file to include database configurations; placed JawsDB details in the `production` property of json file; added details of local database in the `developer` property

* Removed old ORM file, as well as any references to it in `burgers_controller.js`; Replaced with Sequelize methods

* End product functioned just like end procuct of `Eat-Da-Burger` app
